NIP-68
======

Debit Requests
--------------

`wip` `rfc` `optional`

This NIP defines a method for applications to request Lightning payments be made by a users remote wallet with event kind `21002`. This complements [NIP-69](69.md) by allowing the inverse operation, and providing users with a static endpoint that applications and services can use for a more fluid and secure authorization UX than is currently available with LNURL or NWC. 

## Motivation

Beyond the rationale provided in NIP-69, Nostr is also starting to show great potential as a reputational system. Listening for ad-hoc debit requests to achieve better UX comes with the trade-off of adding reputational tools to mitigate noise. There is no greater honeypot to identify malicious keys and normalize reputational filters than ad-hoc debit requests. We already have scam/spam DM's and notes that need to be interpreted, this kind would allow scammers to skip the social engineering steps for more expeditious flagging (e.g. NIP-56) by legitimate users.

## Specification

### Debit Request Pointers 

A debit request pointer is a bech32 (per [NIP-19](19.md)) encoded string prefixed with `ndebit`. 
The encoded string will include the following TLV (Type-Length-Value) items:

- `0`: The 32 bytes of the wallet service's public key, encoded in hex.
- `1`: The relay URL where the wallet service subscribes to payment requests.
- `2`: Pointer Identifier.

If the pointer ID is not declared, the requestor may assume that the listening key is acting as the identifier and omit the ID field from their request.

Example pointer structure:

```
ndebit1...
  0: <wallet_service_pubkey_hex>
  1: <relay_url>
  2: <pointer_id> 
```

## Integration with other NIPs

### NIP-01 User Metadata

Users might advertise this capability so that all of their apps have the pay source awareness. 

Example user metadata content with `nip68` field:
```json
{
  "pubkey": "hex_pub",
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\": \"bob\", \"nip05\": \"bob@example.com\", \"nip68\": \"ndebit1...\"}"
  // ...
}
```

### NIP-05 "Lightning Addresses"

To make connecting an app to your wallet as simple as pasting your Lightning Address, name services can add a `nip68` field in the NIP-05 content for pointer discovery on name-based lookups.

Example NIP-05 Service Response with Debit Request Pointers


```json
{
  "names": {
    "bob": "hex_pub"
  },
  "nip68": {
    "bob": "ndebit1..."
  }
}
```

## Nostr Events

This NIP specifies use of event kind `21002` with the following structure: 

- `content`: NIP-44 encrypted request details.
- `tags`: 
  - `p`: Receiver's public key (hex).
  - `e`: Used in response to the requesting event.

Example request event:

```json
{
  "id": "<event_id>",
  "pubkey": "<application_pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 21002,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<wallet_pubkey>"]
  ],
  "content": "<NIP-44 encrypted request>",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

The `content` field after NIP-44 decryption must contain an object of like structure:

```json
{
    "pointer": "<pointer_id>", // optionally undefined
    "amount_sats": 1000000,
    "bolt11": "<BOLT11_invoice_string>",
    "description": "<optional_app_data>"
}
```
The wallet service MAY require `amount_sats` in order to process rules without first decoding the invoice, but MUST then ensure the invoice amount matches this before completing the request.

### Response events

Wallet services should ACK with the preimage when a request is fulfilled.

The wallet service MAY respond with a **GFY** (General Failure to Yield) code when a request will not be fulfilled.

1. ACK with Lightning preimage:

```json
{
  "id": "<response_event_id>",
  "pubkey": "<wallet_pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1234567891,
  "kind": 21002,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<application_pubkey>"],
    ["e", "<event_id>"] // original request event ID
  ],
  "content": "<NIP-44 encrypted {\"res\":\"ok\",\"preimage\":\"<lightning_preimage>\"}>",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

2. GFY response:

```json
{ // ...
  "content": "<NIP-44 encrypted {\"res\":\"GFY\",\"code\":\"2.2\",\"error\":\"Unknown Lightning Failure\"}>",
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

## GFY Handling

To facilitate consistent handling across implementations, this NIP defines the following GFY responses:

1. **Warning: Request Denied**: When the request is denied by the wallet service. This serves as a warning to the requestor they may be reported on subsequent attempts.
2. **Temporary Failure**: When the wallet service is temporarily unable to process the request. This can include:
3. **Expired Request**: When the delta between the request and wallet time (unix) is too great (Default 30s).
4. **Rate Limited**: The requestor has been rate-limited by the wallet.
5. **Invalid Amount**: When the amount specified is too big or too small, providing the acceptable range.
6. **Invalid Request**: When the request is in some way malformed. 

### GFY Codes

- 1: Warning: Request Denied
- 2: Temporary Failure
- 3: Expired Request
- 4: Rate Limited
- 5: Invalid Amount
- 6: Invalid Request

Clients MUST handle these responses gracefully and display appropriate messages to users.

### GFY Response Payloads

GFY responses must be sent as kind `21002` events with the following structure in the encrypted content:

```json
{
  "res": "GFY",
  "code": <gfy_code>,
  "error": "<gfy_message>",
  // Additional fields optionally included depending on the error type
}
```

       "code": 5,
       "error": "Invalid Amount",
       "range": {
         "min": 10,
         "max": 1000000
       }
     }

     {
       "res": "GFY",
       "code": 6,
       "error": "Invalid Request"
     }
     ```

Applications MUST handle these error responses gracefully and display appropriate messages to users.

## Process Flow

1. User provides their pointer via direct paste or NIP-05 to an application.
2. Application parses the debit pointer for the public key of the listener (user's wallet service), the relay on which it's listening, and an identifying value.
3. Application sends a debit request event (kind 2102) to the specified relay.
4. User's wallet service receives the request and either:
   a) Prompts the user to approve/deny the payment, or
   b) Automatically approves/denies based on predefined rules.
5. If approved, the wallet service processes the payment and adds the preimage details in the encrypted content of an ACK response.
6. Wallet service sends a response event (kind 2102) with an `e` tag referencing the original request.

* If the request is denied at step 4 the service may, at it's discretion, respond with a GFY code. 

## Wallet Service Behavior

Wallet services should implement the following:

1. Listen for kind 2102 events on specified relays.
2. Implement user-defined rules for automatic approval/denial based on requesting application's pubkey, amount, and other factors.
3. Prompt the user for manual approval when necessary.
4. Send kind 2102 response events.
5. Process payments for approved requests.

## Wallet Client Behavior

Wallet clients should implement the following:

1. Notifications and inboxes for pending requests.
2. An address book of whitelisted / blacklisted keys.
3. Reporting functionality (ex: NIP-56)
4. Completed request payments in transaction history.
5. Source verification: Allow user to inspect the signature of the event and/or provide context known about the requesting key. 

## Application Behavior

Applications should:

1. Obtain the user's NIP-68 debit link.
2. Send kind 2102 events to request payments.
3. Listen for kind 2102 response events.
4. Handle approvals and denials appropriately.
5. Source verification: Provide astute users with the requesting key and signature they can use to verify authenticity of the request.

## Security Considerations

1. All content fields must be encrypted using [NIP-44](44.md).
2. Wallet services should implement strong authentication and atomic transactions to ensure that only authorized applications are granted debits and are properly constrained by user-defined budgets.
3. Users should be educated about the implications of setting auto-approval rules.
4. Wallet services should consider implementing "fail2ban" schemes and NIP-56 reporting to discourage abuse.
